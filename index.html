      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>My name is Saul Greene and I am 24 years old. I live in Seattle Washington, more specifically, Seward Park. Some of my favorite things to do include snowboarding, hottubing, and driving (not in traffic!). Most people look at me like im crazy when I say that I love to drive, however it both relaxes and excites me. I try to get a drive in at least once a day which has become hard since I started my education at Code Fellows seeing as I now take the light rail and walk. I hope to one day be able to afford some sort of a newer sports car than I do right now.</p>

    <div class="Education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I graduated from Washington State University in 2015 and continued onto law school at California Western School of Law (CWSL) in San Diego. I attended CWSL for a year before deciding that law school was not for me. I then took some time off to work and eventually landed at Code Fellows to coninue my education.</p>

      <h2>Job Experience</h2>
      <p>I have worked many little jos here and there that you can find in my <a href="URL I NEED TO CONNECT MY RESUME TO"> Resume</a> however, after law school I did work at Audi Seattle for a while since I loved cars and what not. I soon realized that I wanted to go back to school though.</p>
